## LLM Documentation Files

- [Full documentation](https://www.assistant-ui.com/llms-full.txt): every documentation page rendered into one large text file.
- Per-page markdown: append `.md` to any docs page URL. `.mdx` is kept as a backwards-compatible alias for agents that request source-style URLs. For example, `/docs/installation.md` and `/docs/installation.mdx` both return markdown for `/docs/installation`.
- Markdown by Accept header: requesting a docs, examples, design or elements page with `Accept: text/markdown` also returns that page's markdown.
- Use the index below to choose a specific page. Remove the `.md` or `.mdx` suffix to open the human-readable docs page.
